wasn say goodbye maybe hurt couldn pack things walk door drive away girl yesterday take plane foreign land stay home try hard understand close away girl yesterday know right know wrong know pain come wait long count teardrops cry away know deep heart someday light window wait phone talk memory come home dream return things girl yesterday
