sweet soft summer nights dance shadow distant light come follow kiss distant shore long quiet hours play sound tomorrow yesterday come follow kiss distant shore careful glance children play raindrops fall say quiet thoughts caress time breeze summer go whisper memories nights grow long come follow kiss distant shore
