hello darkness friend come talk vision softly creep leave seed sleep vision plant brain remain sound silence restless dream walk narrow streets cobblestone neath halo street lamp turn collar cold damp eye stab flash neon light split night touch sound silence naked light thousand people maybe people talk speak people hear listen people write songs voice share dare disturb sound silence fool say know silence like cancer grow hear word teach arm reach word like silent raindrops fell echo silence people bow pray neon sign flash warn word form sign say word prophets write subway wall tenement halls whisper sound silence
