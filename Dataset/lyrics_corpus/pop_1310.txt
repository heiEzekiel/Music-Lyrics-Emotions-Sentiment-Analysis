time tavern raise glass remember laugh away hours dream great things days friend think sing dance forever live life choose fight lose young sure busy years go rush lose starry notions tavern smile days friend think sing dance forever live life choose fight lose days days tonight stand tavern glass strange reflection lonely woman days friend think sing dance forever live life choose fight lose days days door come familiar laughter face hear friend older wiser hearts dream days friend think sing dance forever live life choose fight lose days days
