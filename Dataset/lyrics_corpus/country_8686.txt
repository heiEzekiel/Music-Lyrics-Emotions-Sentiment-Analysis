rodeo room drink beer relax awhile sing cowboy tune guitar pass batter scratch break lord sound mighty fine sing cowpoke think tune wail away dunder play spoon sing break tell poem crack joke damn nearly sing cowpoke someday road travel lord leave memories things see leave mind quiet summer even sink think days go sing cowpoke
