winter gaze streets walk snow city sleet room winter forget memories remember tree leave cry window wait laugh slightly tree shield meadow makin even go girl lamp post hear spring freeze rain go girl time slow till cold room wall go winter good time like memories spring come winter wish streets laughter tear ease pain
