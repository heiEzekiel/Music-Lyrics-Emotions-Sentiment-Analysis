look pool dark depths face beckon plain know believe felt strange go insane doubt think head eye instead hours spend gaze pool draw know drain strength away ask stay nightmares spirit call nightmares leave life blood slowly drain away feel weaker know long join pool feel near begin clear nightmares come time nightmares peace mind clear know look hand hand jump right pool want drown forever nightmares forever call nightmares rest peace
